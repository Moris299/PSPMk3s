;In Prusa Slicer go to: Printer Settings -> Custom G-code and after deleting custom start G-code paste whole from this .txt file

;This is better START G-code for MK3s. This GCODE is made to prevent filament oozing from nozzle during heating up. 
;With this G-code printer will heat up bed first, but nozzle will stop heating at 175Â°C, 
;then it will home x-y axis and start mesh bed leveling and in the same starts warming up the nozzle to the desired temperature
;then go outside print area and wait for nozzle temperature, and then draw a cleaning line  
;It is based on original start G-code it has function to tell printer latest fw version, orinal flowrate setting and current setting. Heating up and homing process is upgraded.
